Attendance Planning & Decision Support System
Version: 1.0

Date: January 2026

Team: TE Data Science, Batch 2023-27

Project Type: 6th Semester Mini-Project

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 1.1 Problem Statement Students face attendance-related
academic detention due to lack of forward-looking planning tools. Current systems only show
historical percentages, leaving students unable to answer critical questions:

"Can I skip today's class safely?" "When does recovery become mathematically
impossible?" "Which subject needs urgent attention?" This leads to:

Surprise detentions (students thought they were safe) Impossible recovery attempts (trying
when it's too late) Poor resource allocation (focusing on wrong subjects) 1.2 Solution
Overview A decision support system (not a tracking system) that transforms attendance from
a backward-looking report into a forward-looking planning resource. The system calculates
attendance buffers, recovery paths, and critical deadlines using:

Academic calendar (holidays, teaching weeks) Subject timetables (lectures, labs per week)
Current attendance state (from monthly faculty reports or manual entry) 1.3 Success Criteria
Students can make skip decisions in ≤30 seconds Point of No Return calculated accurately

                                                                                  ❌
for all subjects System works with monthly updates (not daily tracking) 90% of calculations

USER PERSONAS Persona 1: Crisis Responder (Primary Target - 60% of users) Profile:
Rajesh, TE DS student, received defaulter notice in February

Current attendance: 68% in ML, 72% in DAV Motivation: High (detention threat) Tech savvy:
Medium Update frequency: Once when in crisis, then weekly Use Case: "I got a defaulter
notice. Is it too late to recover? If not, what exactly do I need to do?"

Key Features Needed:

Upload faculty defaulter list → auto-populate data Recovery feasibility check Week-by-week
recovery roadmap Persona 2: Preventive Planner (Secondary - 30% of users) Profile: Priya,
TE DS student, currently at 80-85% across subjects

Wants to skip strategically for placements/internships Motivation: Medium (proactive
planning) Update frequency: Weekly or before important skip decisions Use Case: "I have a
placement drive next week. Which 3 classes can I safely skip?"

Key Features Needed:
"What if I skip?" simulation 7-day lookahead with risk labels Subject-wise buffer visibility
Persona 3: Last-Minute Checker (Tertiary - 10% of users) Profile: Ankit, TE DS student,
checks app morning of each class

Currently safe but wants daily confirmation Motivation: Low (convenience) Update
frequency: Daily (but inconsistent) Use Case: "Can I skip today's 9:30 AM ML class?"

Key Features Needed:

Today's schedule with safe/risky labels Quick impact preview Fast decision (no multi-step
process) 3. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS 3.1 Core Features (Must-Have for MVP)
Feature 1: Traffic Light Dashboard User Story: As a student, I want to see which subjects
need urgent attention at a glance.

Requirements:

                                              🔴
🟡                                                       🟢
Display all subjects with color-coded status:  Red: Deficit (currently <75%) OR buffer ≤1
   Yellow: Caution (buffer 2-4) OR approaching PNR       Green: Safe (buffer ≥5) Show
current percentage per subject Show buffer/deficit count Update in real-time as data
changes Acceptance Criteria:

All subjects visible without scrolling on mobile (compact cards) Tap subject card → detailed
view Color scheme follows standard traffic light convention Works with stale data (shows
confidence level) Feature 2: Skip Impact Simulator User Story: As a student, I want to see
consequences before skipping a class.

Requirements:

For any upcoming class, show: Current percentage Percentage after skipping Buffer change
Risk level change Allow "what if" testing without committing Batch simulation (select multiple
classes) Acceptance Criteria:

Calculation completes in <200ms Shows both current and projected state side-by-side
Warns if action causes status change (Green→Yellow) Blocks simulation if would drop below
75% Calculation Logic:

New % = Current_Attended / (Current_Conducted + 1) × 100 New Buffer = Total_Classes ×
0.25 - (Total_Classes - New_Attended - New_Skipped) Feature 3: Point of No Return (PNR)
Calculator User Story: As a student, I want to know the exact date when recovery becomes
impossible.

Requirements:

For each subject, calculate date when: (Required_Attendances - Current_Attended) >
Remaining_Classes Display as: Exact date if within semester "Already passed" if recovery
impossible "Safe - no PNR this semester" if buffer sufficient Show countdown (e.g., "12 days
until PNR") Acceptance Criteria:

Accounts for holidays and non-teaching days Updates daily automatically Shows warning at
2 weeks before PNR Critical alert at 1 week before PNR Calculation Logic:
python min_required = total_classes × 0.75 deficit = max(0, min_required -
current_attended) if deficit > remaining_classes: PNR = "ALREADY PASSED" else:
weeks_until_pnr = (remaining_classes - deficit) / classes_per_week PNR_date =
current_date + timedelta(weeks=weeks_until_pnr)


---

#### Feature 4: Recovery Path Generator
**User Story:** As a student in deficit, I want a concrete plan to reach 75%.

**Requirements:**
- For subjects <75%, generate:
  - Total additional attendances needed
  - Week-by-week breakdown
  - Maximum achievable % (if recovery impossible)
- Show as timeline/roadmap
- Mark "achievable" or "impossible" clearly

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Shows minimum required attendance streak
- Allows 1-2 buffer misses in plan (realistic)
- Displays "Plan difficulty": Easy/Medium/Hard/Impossible
- Updates as student attends classes

**Output Format:**


ML Recovery Plan (Currently 68%) Goal: 75% by 15 May 2026

Required: Attend 22 of next 28 classes Strategy:

      ●​ Week 3-6: Attend ALL classes (4/week) ← Critical
      ●​ Week 7-10: Can miss max 1 per week
      ●​ Week 11+: Can miss max 1 per week

Result: 75.8% at semester end ✓ ACHIEVABLE

## 7. BUSINESS LOGIC RULES
### 7.1 Attendance Calculation


Current % = (Attended / Conducted) × 100

Buffer = Floor(Total × 0.25) - (Total - Attended) where Total = Conducted + Remaining

Deficit = Ceiling(Total × 0.75) - Attended


### 7.2 Status Classification


IF current_pct < 75 OR buffer <= 0: status = "CRITICAL" (Red) ELIF buffer <= 1 OR
(pnr_date - today) <= 14 days: status = "RISKY" (Yellow)​
 ELIF buffer >= 5: status = "SAFE" (Green) ELSE: status = "CAUTION" (Yellow)


### 7.3 PNR Calculation


min_required = Total × 0.75 current_shortfall = min_required - Attended

IF current_shortfall > Remaining: PNR = "ALREADY PASSED" ELIF current_shortfall <= 0:
PNR = "NONE" (Safe) ELSE: sessions_until_pnr = Remaining - current_shortfall weeks =
sessions_until_pnr / sessions_per_week PNR = today + (weeks × 7 days)

## 8. CONSTRAINTS & ASSUMPTIONS

### 8.1 Assumptions
1. Semester has 16 teaching weeks (standard)
2. Lab sessions count as 2× lecture hours
3. Minimum attendance requirement is 75% (institute policy)
4. Students can access timetable and calendar PDFs
5. Monthly defaulter lists are available from faculty
6. Students have smartphones with modern browsers

### 8.2 Known Limitations
1. Cannot auto-sync with biometric systems (manual entry required)
2. Accuracy depends on user updating data
3. No notification system (students must open app)
4. Single-user only (no class-wide analytics)
5. Cannot account for medical leave adjustments automatically

### 8.3 Risk Mitigation
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Students don't update data | Event-driven prompts, batch updates, work with stale data |
| Incorrect manual entry | Validation rules, sanity checks, preview before save |
| Timetable changes mid-semester | Manual adjustment capability, re-import option |
| Different attendance policies per subject | Configurable minimum % per subject |
| Data loss | Export/import functionality, localStorage backup |

## 11. APPENDIX

### 11.1 Sample Calculations (Reference)

**Scenario:** ML subject, Week 2 of 16
- Lectures: 3/week × 16 weeks = 48
- Labs: 1/week × 16 weeks × 2 hours = 32
- Total sessions: 80
- Conducted so far: 8 (2 weeks × 4 sessions/week)
- Attended: 6
- Missed: 2

**Calculations:**


Current % = 6/8 × 100 = 75% Remaining = 80 - 8 = 72 Min required = 80 × 0.75 = 60 Buffer
= 60 - (80 - 6 - 72) = 60 - 2 = 58?

CORRECT: Current attended = 6 Total sessions = 80 Min required at end = 80 × 0.75 = 60
Already attended = 6 Still need to attend = 60 - 6 = 54 Remaining sessions = 72 Buffer = 72 -
54 = 18 classes can be missed

Status: SAFE (Green) 11.2 Glossary Buffer: Number of classes that can be missed while
staying ≥75% Deficit: Number of additional classes needed to reach 75% Conducted: Total
classes held so far (present + absent) PNR: Point of No Return - date when 75% becomes
impossible Recovery Path: Step-by-step plan to reach 75% from deficit Document Approved
